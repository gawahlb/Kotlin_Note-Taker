# Overview

While I have worked with Java previously, I have never had the opportunity to work with Kotlin. As I am trying to expand my repertoire of programming languages I am able to use, I thought that creating a simple note-taking program would be a great place to start with Kotlin.

This software is a simple note-taking app. It accepts new notes from the user with a title being the identifying feature of the note. It also allows the user to delete notes, search through notes, save their notes as a file, and load previously created notes.

This software was created primarily to give me an opportunity to use Kotlin and to explore the different aspects of programming with Kotlin. I wanted an opportunity to use variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, as well as the creation and modification of lists. This is why I encased all the notes in a mutable list.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
